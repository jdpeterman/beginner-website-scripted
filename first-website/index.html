     <h1>Buddy Hield: Player of the Year</h1>
     <img src="images/buddy-hield.jpg" alt="A picture of Buddy Hield">
     
     <p>Reasons why he's the best player in the country:</p>
     <ul>
     <li>Named Big 12 Player of the Year</li>
     <li>17.4 points and 5.4 rebounds per game</li>
     <li>Future NBA Draft lottery pick</li>
     </ul>
           

      <p>I still find it hard to believe OU basketball is in the top five in the AP poll. They deserved to be there though after beating a good Villanova team by double digits. The only thing I wish was that all OU fans realized how good their basketball team is. Lloyd Noble Center rarely sells out and it hurts me to see all the empty seats when I watch their games on television.</p>
