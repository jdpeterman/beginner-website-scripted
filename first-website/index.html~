         <h1>Buddy Hield: Player of the Year</h1>
            <p>Reasons why he's the best player in the country</p>
               <ul>
                 <li>He's Kobe's idol</li>
                 <li>He's from the Bahamas</li>
                 <li>He can really shoot the ball</li>
               </ul>
            <p>I still find it hard to believe OU basketball is in the top five in the AP poll. They deserved to be there though after beating a good Villanova team by double digits. The only thing I wish was that all OU fans realized how good their basketball team is. Lloyd Noble Center rarely sells out and it hurts to see all the empty seats when I watch their games on television.</p>
